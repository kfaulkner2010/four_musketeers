Nissan Manufacturing Final Analysis


•	All the raw data can be found in the Main branch in the ‘Data’ folder.

•	Each person worked on a few questions and their scripts cyphering through the data can be found within each of their won branches.



Major Findings


•	After analyzing user performance, we discovered that most users fall within ±0.5 standard deviations from the mean task time, with a few notable outliers on the lower end of the graph.

Interestingly, you might assume that a higher number of standard deviations indicates better performance, but in this case, it reflects the opposite.

•	In addressing question number 5 with the API, we retrieved the country codes to create a world map visualizing the quantity of materials ordered by country. The resulting visualization reveals that Nissan actively supports domestic businesses in the United States, 

where we see the largest concentration of orders. Notably, Japan, the birthplace of Nissan, ranks as the second highest in orders, highlighting the company's strong roots in its home country.

•	Upon analyzing the day and night shifts, it appears that both shifts consistently ship approximately the same amount of material. This indicates a balanced workload, with neither shift relying on the other to pick up the slack.
